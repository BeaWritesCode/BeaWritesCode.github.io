I've been a developer for many years but recently I've been solely focused on writing JavaScript behind the scenes on a single platform so it's time to brush up on my CSS and HTML, as well as catch up on changes in accessibility and usability. That means I'm going back to basics - it's time to retire my knowledge of IE8 bug hacks and floated layouts, and replace it with a good understanding of flexbox, grid and building for modern, compliant browsers! To some extent I've reverted to being a newbie again. Who knew the fountain of youth could be found in code?
