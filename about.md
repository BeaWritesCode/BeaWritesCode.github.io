I've been a developer for many years but recently I've been solely focused on writing JavaScript behind the scenes on a single platform so it's time to brush up on my CSS and HTML, as well as catch up on changes in accessibility and usability. That means I'm going back to basics - it's time to retire my knowledge of IE8 bug hacks and floated layouts, and replace it with a good understanding of flexbox, grid and building for modern, compliant browsers! To some extent I've reverted to being a newbie again. Who knew the fountain of youth could be found in code?

I'm curious to know whether we need CSS resets any more or have modern browsers done away with the need? What are the trends in design? How far has accessibility come along and what's the situation with WAI-ARIA? Do I need to learn hacks for working around browser bugs or are they fixed before they've the chance to strike now we have such frequent updates? How about build tools? Perhaps Gulp and npm are now very _last year_ and something else is the New Black &trade;
