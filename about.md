Every few years I like to go back to basics to unlearn cruft development techniques that are taking up space in my brain. There are so many things to consider when building a website or an app that it’s easy to risk forgetting _why_ one uses certain techniques, and just go along with the automatic part of your brain that “knows” what you’ve written is the right approach. A while later you realise the approach in question was a workaround for a specific bug that’s long since been fixed or to create a design feature that is now supported in newer HTML and CSS standards.

Having spent the last decade or so focused on JavaScript for multi-national corporate intranets my CSS and accessibility skills are a bit rusty and let’s face it, if you don’t use it you lose it! So in my goal to sharpen my expert knowledge I set my ego aside and put myself into newbie shoes. When undertaking this exercise I often find a refreshed enthusiasm for my work as I refresh my skills; a renewed thrill at the wonder and shininess of new toys!

I'm curious whether we still require CSS resets or have modern browsers done away with the need? What are the trends in design? How far has accessibility come and what's the situation with WAI-ARIA? Do I need to learn hacks for working around browser bugs or are they fixed too quickly to worry about? How about build tools? What is the New Black &trade;?
