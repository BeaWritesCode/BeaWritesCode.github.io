## Update 25th November 2012 ##

I've finished building the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj) now and pushed the final code to my [Order summary component repository](https://github.com/BeaWritesCode/order-summary-component-main) on GitHub. Take a look at <a href="/pages/order-summary-component">my styled order summary component</a> and let me know what you think via issues on the repository!

~~I've been working on the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). I'm only part way through but if you want to have a nose then you'll find my progress in my [Order summary component repository](https://github.com/BeaWritesCode/order-summary-component-main) on GitHub. Feedback is welcomed!~~
