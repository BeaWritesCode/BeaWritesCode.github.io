I've been working on the [Order summary card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj). I'm only part way through but if you want to have a nose then you'll find my progress in my [Order summary component repository](https://github.com/BeaWritesCode/order-summary-component-main) on GitHub. Feedback is welcomed!
